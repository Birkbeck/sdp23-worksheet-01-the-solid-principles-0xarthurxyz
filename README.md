# Worksheet One â€” SOLID design principles

This worksheet contains examples of the five SOLID design principles of object-oriented programming. 
For each example, consider the problem and then how the code contravenes the SOLID principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle,
- Open/Closed Principle,
- Liskov Substitution Principle,
- Interface Segregation Principle,
- Dependency Inversion Principle.
